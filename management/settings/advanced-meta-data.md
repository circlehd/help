# Advanced Meta-Data

Enterprises can define Custom Fields as metadata against each uploaded Video in their respective CircleHD Portal. The custom fields can also be used while searching for Videos within the portal. Every time a user uploads a new video, or edits an existing video, the custom fields will be displayed in the edit Video page allowing them to update as needed. 

Only Admins can create Custom Fields using the Portal settings page.
