## How long does Video take to transcode?

Videos once uploaded go through transcoding to optimize its support across various devices and bandwidths. The transcoding time depends on the size of the video primarily. e.g. a 30 min video could take around 5-10 mins to transcode and a 3 hr video could very well be 1-2 hrs. Transcoding is needed only one time during the upload but it does pay off by giving the best end user video experience.
