# What is The Difference Between a Channel and a Playlist?

A Channel is a container of multiple Videos in a folder like view, in other words its categorization of similar topic videos. A Playlist on the other hand, is also grouping of videos together, but each video can be ordered and arranged with a play sequence. This playlist can be shared to CircleHD portal users and external Customers as needed. Playlist is the only way to share videos to external users.
