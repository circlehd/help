# How to Create a new Channel?

## You can create a new channel in two ways:

1- Click on the “+” icon next to “Channels” text in left vertical navigation:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
