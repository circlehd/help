# What is Channels List?

You can organize your video content for your team / company through Channels. As a Channel owner, you can add co-owners and videos about specific topic for employees to view. 

The **Channels List** is also displayed in the left navigation on the home page. 

You can identify Channel as a category keyword which can be used to locate videos for that particular topic. 

A Channel can be either **public**, where every user within that organization can access it OR it can be private / **secured** with limited users having access.
