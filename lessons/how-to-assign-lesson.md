# How to assign a course?

To assign a new course, please follow below steps.

1. You can Assign courses in two ways within CircleHD portal. Once the course \(playlist\) is created, you can click on "Playlists" option in the left vertical menu to view all playlists including courses created by you. If you are the owner of any course, then it will display "Edit \| Assign \| Stats" option below the course.
